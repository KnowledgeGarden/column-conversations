In the standard syntax no fields are required - pass only what you need. Keep in mind you will be able to access any additional properties you specify - jsTree won&#39;t touch them and you will be able to use them later on (using the&nbsp;original&nbsp;property on each node).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To change the icon of the node use the&nbsp;icon&nbsp;property. Specifying a string containing a&nbsp;/&nbsp;will display that image as the node icon. Using any other string will apply that class to the&nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&nbsp;element that is used to represent the icon. You can use boolean&nbsp;false&nbsp;to make jsTree render the node with no icon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can set the state on a node using the&nbsp;state&nbsp;property. Use any combination of the following:&nbsp;opened,&nbsp;selected,&nbsp;disabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both&nbsp;li_attr&nbsp;and&nbsp;a_attr&nbsp;are passed directly to jQuery&#39;s attr function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When using AJAX set&nbsp;children&nbsp;to boolean&nbsp;true&nbsp;and jsTree will render the node as closed and make an additional request for that node when the user opens it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any nested children should either be objects following the same format, or plain strings (in which case the string is used for the node&#39;s text and everything else is autogenerated).</p>\r\n","url":"https://www.jstree.com/docs/json/"}
