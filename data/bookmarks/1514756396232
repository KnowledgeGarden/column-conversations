A first step to prevent divergence was to extract the client code into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki-client\">wiki-client</a>. This wiki-client was then used by both the Ruby and Node servers. However, with both server repositories retained the static components of the client, together with the plug-ins there remained some risk of divergence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this latest version of the node version of Federated Wiki, we continue by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>including all the client components in the wiki-client, and</li>\r\n\t<li>moving all plug-ins into their own repositories, see below for a list.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When we originally extracted the wiki-client, we included it back into wiki whilst building the wiki package. This had the unforeseen consequence that when creating an updated wiki-client it was also necessary to create a new version of the wiki package for the updated client to be available. To avoid this we no longer include wiki packages in the package for the server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we have a new wiki repository, and package, which only exist to pull together the federated wiki modules (wiki-server, wiki-client, and plug-ins) and start the server.</p>\r\n","url":"https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki"}
